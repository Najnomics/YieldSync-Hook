# YieldSync-Hook
YieldSync Hook is a Uniswap V4 hook that integrates with an EigenLayer AVS to automatically adjust liquidity provider positions in LST pools. The system compensates for natural yield drift by moving LP positions "up the curve" based on real-time yield data from stETH, rETH, cbETH, and other liquid staking tokens.
